## Summary of the Project

This is the project I implemented with my colleague Emilienne as part of the Hackathon project in 2 and a half day, for which we worked with a team of four web developers as part of the Wild Code School formation program. Wild School gave us four different datasets which consist of the informations about different cities and they demanded us to work with developer team in order to create a website of travel configurator. We chose the most important variables from the datasets and transferred the json file to the developer team for which they make a form of travel configuration for the users and integrate the informations in the json file to their website. A cause of the time constraint, they couldn't integrate all of the informations to their site and we made an application on Streamlit which consists of a travel configuration form. We used KNN machine learning model which makes the destination recommendations with respect to the informations the user provided via the travel configuration form. 

## The datasets we used for the project

The datasets could be found on the following links:

~~~~~
- City happiness index: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/city-happiness-index-2024)
- Cost of living of the cities: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living?select=cost-of-living_v2.csv)
- Daily temperatures of the cities: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities)
- List of World Cities by Population Density: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/list-of-world-cities-by-population-density)
~~~~~

We used city happiness index and cost of living datasets from those four different datasets. We didn't used the city happiness index because we decided that the informations in the dataset weren't useful for the objectif of the project. We found and used a different dataset for the population information of the cities since there was very little data in the above data set. The dataset on population of the cities could be found on the following link:
